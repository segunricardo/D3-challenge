    <h2>Research finds correlation between Healthcare coverage and income</h2>
    <p>Our research team at the Health Policy Corner has found some revealing data on the correlation that links the population's net income level, and their access to healthcare. The aim of this mini-project, was to find out which states in the U.S. are least covered by healthcare systems, and how these relate to poverty levels across the nation.</p>

      <p>As indicated in a recent article by Business Insider (link below), there are obvious reasons to believe that the 15 poorest states in the country will also have a noticeable lack of health services, the scatter plot above supports this hypothesis by showing that states like Mississippi, New Mexico, Louisiana, Alabama, Georgia and New Mexico have particularly high rates of uncovered Americans, while also having a great deal of people under the national poverty lines. On the other hand, states like Massachusetts, Maryland, Minnesota, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Connecticut, stand out for having most of their populations covered and with very few of them in poverty. California lies somewhere in the middle, given its size (economically and geographically), while florida does so at the same level but with higher levels of uncovered residents. The most salient case is the state of Texas, which lies somewhere in the middle in terms of national wealth, but strikes as being one of the states with the lowest percentages of residents with healthcare.</p>
